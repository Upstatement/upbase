/// Hides text, but shows everything else like background colors, images, etc.
///
/// **Warning:** This has been known to mistakenly fail as invalid CSS, and apparently it fails completely in Opera Mini, with the text fallback completely obscured. Recommendation is to use proper mixins, with accessibility considered, such as `visually-hidden`, `hidden`, and `invisible` despite them requiring two separate elements.
